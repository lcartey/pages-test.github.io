# Constant return type
This rule finds non-member functions with a superfluous `const` qualifier on their return type.


## Recommendation
The superfluous `const` qualifier should be removed, as it serves no purpose. If the return type contains embedded qualifiers, then care should be taken to remove only the superfluous one.


## Example

```cpp
// The leftmost const has no effect here.
const int square(const int x) {
  return x * x;
}

// The const has no effect here, and can easily be mistaken for const char*.
char* const id(char* s) {
  return s;
}

```
