# Returning stack-allocated memory
This rule finds return statements that return pointers to an object allocated on the stack. The lifetime of a stack allocated memory location only lasts until the function returns, and the contents of that memory become undefined after that. Clearly, using a pointer to stack memory after the function has already returned will have undefined results.


## Recommendation
Use the functions of the `malloc` family to dynamically allocate memory on the heap for data that is used across function calls.


## Example

```cpp
Record* fixRecord(Record* r) {
	Record myRecord = *r;
	delete r;

	myRecord.fix();
	return &myRecord; //returns reference to myRecord, which is a stack-allocated object
}

```
